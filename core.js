/* ============================================================================
   core.js — shared truths. Loaded before k.js on every page.

   Two jobs.

   1. DECIDE WHETHER THIS IS THE LIVE SITE, from the address rather than from a
      build step. Previously build-test.sh *inserted* window.__POD_TEST into a
      copy of the file, which meant the test site and the live site could never
      be byte-identical — so no diff between them was meaningful, and the only
      record of what was waiting to go live was somebody's memory.
      Now: one host is live, everything else is a sandbox. It fails safe — an
      unrecognised address is treated as a sandbox, never as live.

   2. SHOW WHAT IS WAITING TO GO LIVE, on the page, on the test site only.
      Reads pending.json next to it. If that file is missing the chip simply
      doesn't appear.

   3. READ THE CHANGE LOG. Both boards keep a log of the same shape, and both
      offer the same two ways of reading it, so the sorting and filtering live
      here once rather than drifting apart in two files.
   ============================================================================ */

/* The live site is that one host over http(s). A local file keeps its own
   behaviour (it saves to the file via the File System API, so it must not be
   diverted into browser storage). An explicit window.__POD_TEST set by a build
   still wins, so rota.salford.icu/test.html carries on working. */

   CHANGE LOG — reading entries of the shape { t, who, msg, kind, on }.

   t   when the change was made.
   on  which rota day it changed. Different from t: fixing next Tuesday on a
       Monday afternoon is one entry with two dates. Null when the change isn't
       about a particular day at all — a password, a new starter.
   kind "manual" (a person decided) or "auto" (auto-fill, the retention sweep,
       an import, or the background sync). Stamping the software's decisions
       with whoever happened to be in edit mode was misleading.

   Entries written before kind and on existed carry neither, and there are
   months of them. They are never rewritten — read forgivingly instead:
   unstamped means a person did it, undated falls back to when it was made.
