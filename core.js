   core.js — shared truths. Loaded before k.js on every page.

   Two jobs.

   1. DECIDE WHETHER THIS IS THE LIVE SITE, from the address rather than from a
      build step. Previously build-test.sh *inserted* window.__POD_TEST into a
      copy of the file, which meant the test site and the live site could never
      be byte-identical — so no diff between them was meaningful, and the only
      record of what was waiting to go live was somebody's memory.
      Now: one host is live, everything else is a sandbox. It fails safe — an
      unrecognised address is treated as a sandbox, never as live.

   2. SHOW WHAT IS WAITING TO GO LIVE, on the page, on the test site only.
      Reads pending.json next to it. If that file is missing the chip simply
      doesn't appear.

   3. READ THE CHANGE LOG. Both boards keep a log of the same shape, and both
      offer the same two ways of reading it, so the sorting and filtering live
      here once rather than drifting apart in two files.
   ============================================================================ */

/* THE LIVE ADDRESSES. A LIST, because there is more than one of them now (11 Aug).
   Cover moved to consultants.salford.icu and immediately started showing the TEST banner —
   Scott, via Ali: "Scott's moved across to consultants.salford.icu but says test site banner at
   bottom." Nothing had been redirected; the site was serving the real files and the real data.
   The check simply did not know the address, and an unknown address is treated as a sandbox.

   That fail-safe is right and stays. What was wrong was hard-coding one host for a product that
   now has two front doors — and the cost was not cosmetic: the banner reads "Nothing here changes
   the real cover", which was false, and would reasonably stop somebody making a change they had
   every right to make.

   Adding a live address means adding it here. Anything not on this list is still a sandbox. */

   Hard-coding it could not work: staging and live are separate repos serving the SAME file, so a
   fixed title is wrong on one of them whatever it says. Deriving it removes the choice.

       about a particular day at all — a password, a new starter.
   kind "manual" (a person decided) or "auto" (auto-fill, the retention sweep,
       an import, or the background sync). Stamping the software's decisions
       with whoever happened to be in edit mode was misleading.

   Entries written before kind and on existed carry neither, and there are

     - inside a group the entries run OLDEST FIRST, because a series reads forwards. Newest-first
       is right for "what just happened" and wrong for "how did we get here".

   THE DAY STRIP — ONE COMPONENT, BOTH BOARDS.

   Ali, 10 Aug, on being told the two boards had two different strips: "tey dont
   need to be thoguh do they, and shiould be." Correct. They were never meant to
   diverge; the Pod Board grew a scrolling strip of wide pills with status dots
   and Cover grew a fixed seven-across of small two-line ones, and nobody chose
   that. logPanel and groupLog already live here for exactly this reason, so the
   strip joins them and the boards stop being able to drift apart.

   ALL SEVEN, NOTHING SCROLLS (Ali chose this over a smoother scroller, 10 Aug).
   The scrolling version generated three separate complaints — every press
   selected the next day instead of scrolling, it was unclear whether today
   should sit left or centred, and a new week did not land on its Monday. None
   of the three is a bug in the scroller: they are all consequences of there
   being a scroller. Seven pills that always fit have no scroll position to get
   wrong, no question of where today belongs, and nothing to default to.

   STYLED INLINE, ON PURPOSE. There is no shared stylesheet — core.css is a
   different file on each board — so a class-based strip would need the same
   rules maintained in two places, which is the exact failure this is undoing.
   The only thing it takes from the page is var(--accent), which is blue on the
   Pod Board and amber on Cover, so today's ring matches whichever board it is
   drawn on without being told.

   FOUR SIGNALS THAT DO NOT COLLIDE: chosen is solid, today is a ring, the past
   is faded, the weekend is tinted. They are on independent properties, so a
   Saturday that has already been still reads as both.

   READING THE OLD ENTRIES BACK INTO FIELDS.

   Ali, 10 Aug: "make sure all historic events get rewritten with new eassy to
   use change log format please somehow. wont take no, find a way."

   This is the way, and it is the one that does not cost anything. The rows are
   not rewritten — they are PARSED, here, at the moment they are drawn. The 330
   stored entries keep the exact bytes they were written with, so the log has
   still never edited its own past, which matters because a log that revises
   itself is not evidence of anything. Delete this table and every row falls
   back to the sentence it always was.

   It is only possible because the old messages are not free prose. Every one of
   them came out of a template at one of about sixty call sites across the two
   boards, so there is a finite list of shapes and each one can be read back
   into the same fields a new entry would have carried. Where a shape genuinely
   never recorded a fact, the field is left absent rather than guessed — an
   invented From is worse than a blank one.

   `old: true` is stamped on everything that comes through here so the renderer
   can tell a parsed row from a natively structured one, and so a test can prove
   the parser is not quietly taking over from the writers.

   ADDING A SHAPE: put the regex nearest the top that cannot be matched by an
   earlier one, and return the fields you can actually justify from the text.
